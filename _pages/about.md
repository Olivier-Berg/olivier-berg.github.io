I'm Olivier Berg, I study Politics, Philosophy and Economics at the University of Oxford and I come from Utrecht in the Netherlands.

See my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Olivier-Berg/PPE-notes) for all my notes and essays that I write for my degree.

Some of my interests are:
* Programming and machine learning
* European policy
* Weird or existential philosophical positions
